Prop Drilling :
when you have to pass some data from top component to leaf component and you choose to pass the data through props of  component at each level, it is called prop drilling and is a issue.
We need some sort of data layer through which we can fetch data at real time.
this data layer is called react context api or REDUX.
the way we do it dispatch 

Redux is in dev from longer time , it is production steady but context api is so lightweigth and easy to use.
